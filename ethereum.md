### Ethereum

#### What is Ethereum?

- Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain network and software development platform, powered by the cyptocurrency ether (ETH).
- Ethereum is a public blockchain that went live in July 2015, created by Vitalik Buterin and a group of co-founders.
- Bitcoin showed the world how to send and receive digital money. Ethereum took that idea further by introducing smart contracts — small programs that run on the blockchain.
- Smart contracts allow people to create their own digital assets and apps, called dapps, that work all the time, anywhere in the world. Unlike banks or big companies, these apps are open to anyone with an internet connection.
- Since then, Ethereum has grown into a large ecosystem. It now supports digital assets like stablecoins, NFTs, and governance tokens, along with dapps for finance, art, gaming, and even social media.
- Together, this new world is called Web3 — the next stage of the internet, where people can truly own and control their digital assets.
- At the heart of all this is Ethereum's native cryptocurrency ether (ETH), a new kind of digital money used to power the whole network.
